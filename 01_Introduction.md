# High-Performance Event Galleries: A CLI Workflow

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide for photographers, developers, and website managers to process a large number of high-resolution event photos for the web. The goal is to create a fast, efficient, and scalable online gallery without overwhelming your server or slowing down your website for visitors.

We will use powerful command-line interface (CLI) tools available on macOS and Linux to create a repeatable, automated workflow.

### The Problem

Uploading 300+ high-resolution photos directly to a website, especially on shared hosting, will cause:
*   **Slow Page Load Times:** Large files take a long time to download.
*   **High Server Load:** The server struggles to handle and serve massive files.
*   **Poor User Experience:** Visitors will leave a slow-loading site.
*   **Wasted Disk Space:** Storing unnecessarily large images eats up your hosting plan's disk space.

### The Solution: A Local-First Workflow

We will perform all the heavy image processing on our local machine **before** uploading. This ensures our server's resources (CPU, RAM) are dedicated to serving visitors, not resizing images.

Our workflow will cover:
1.  **Installation:** Setting up the necessary CLI tools.
2.  **Organization:** Creating a clean folder structure.
3.  **Resizing & Compression:** Creating web-ready JPEGs.
4.  **Conversion:** Creating next-gen, highly optimized WebP images.
5.  **Thumbnail Generation:** Creating small thumbnails for gallery grids.
6.  **Website Best Practices:** Final steps for uploading and configuration.

### Prerequisites
*   A computer running macOS or a Linux distribution.
*   Access to the Terminal (or a similar command-line shell).
*   For macOS: [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager installed.
*   For Linux: `apt` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `dnf` (Fedora/CentOS/RHEL) package managers.
*   Your collection of original, high-resolution images.
